# pendulum_predict
DLCV Final Project (Leela Chari, Run Guo, Claudia Tang)

Final versions of our code are within the folder "Final_Versions." Within it are three cases using data from single pendulums, double pendulums, and circular motions. The double pendulum is further broken up into a normal version and a version that was run using a larger model with a larger kernel size for comparison. The circular motion folder has both an attention notebook and a normal one for comparison with how the model implementing a very simple attention architecture performed.
